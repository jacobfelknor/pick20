# Pick 20

A website to play "Pick 20" during NCAA March Madness.

## Rules

Each participant will pick 20 teams from the 64 team pool.

All picks must be submitted before the start of the first game on Thursday morning.

A player can select “the winner” of each of the First Four games on Tuesday and Wednesday (since these games always match up two teams with identical seeds)

Points are earned each time one of the selected teams wins a game as follows:

Seeds 1-4: 1 point earned for each win

Seeds 5-8: 2 points earned for each win

Seeds 9-12: 3 points earned for each win

Seeds 13-16: 4 points earned for each win


The pool winner will be the participant who accumulates the most points. 


## Requirements

* allow each participant to select and edit the 20 teams chosen until the first game starts on Thursday.

* prohibit any changes by any players after the start of the first game on Thursday.

* allow each participant to view ONLY their own selections prior to the start of the first game.

* allow all participants to view the selections for ALL PARTICIPANTS once the first game has started.

* update standings at the conclusion of each game.

* allow all participants to view (and sort?) standings in real time.

* have standings list both points earned to date and potential points possible.
